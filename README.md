## Wordpress plugin created by AI (Chat GPT)

### Chat GPT-3 writing PHP code
ChatGPT is a type of language model that is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. It is trained on a large dataset of text and is able to generate natural-sounding text based on a given prompt.

It's worth noting that GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) is the latest version of GPT and it has the capability to write application. We are using it here - to create custom wp plugin.

### Used prompt
Create a custom WordPress plugin called 'SuperPluginByChatGPT2' that is showing stats about all wordpress users. You need to be logged in to see the stats. Use object-oriented programming.

### About plugin

This code creates a new plugin called "SuperPluginByChatGPT2" that adds a new top-level menu item called "User Stats" to the WordPress admin menu. When a logged-in user clicks on that menu item, the plugin will display a table showing the number of users with each role (administrator, editor, author, and subscriber) and the total number of users.
